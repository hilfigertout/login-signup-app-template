# React Password Authentication Template

This project aims to build a full-stack template for an application that implements user sign-in and secure password authentication. The goal is for developers to be able to use this project as a baseplate to build full-stack applications that require user management and authentication, with the core features of users registering for accounts and logging in already built into the app.

The front end uses React with the react-router-dom library to handle routing. The API server runs on express.js and uses bcrypt to handle password hashing and salting. This project was originally built for a PostgreSQL database running in a Docker container, but since it uses the Knex library, the API server can connect to many different types of relational databases.

This project is a work in progress. Check back later to see if it's complete!
